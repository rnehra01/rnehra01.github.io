        <title>$PATH to GSoC'17</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It started almost a year back when I heard about GSoC for the first time in an introductory lecture by SDSLabs. I was quite
a noob except knowing a little about competitive coding. Then came the day when Google announced the mentoring organisations and I remember going through every single organistion but I couldn’t understand WHAT and WHERE to do. I tried sorting organisations according to programming language but nope, nothing :( I don’t even know about a commit.&lt;/p&gt;
