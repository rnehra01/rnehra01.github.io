<p>I am a Computer Science undergrad studying at IIT Rookee. I am interested in information security. I've tried my hands on binary exploitation, cryptography but love web security in particular. I'm also doing a project based on a web honeypot under GSoC'17. I keep myself updated about security issues through ctfs' participation, HackerOne, twitter and Hacker News. I'm a member of InfoSecIITR, a group of security enthusiats at IIT Roorkee. I also design challenges for ctfs hosted on backdoor.</p>
<p>Apart from this, I like, ohh sorry love cricket. I can watch and play cricker all day. I watch movies, TV shows and sometimes play games mostly Counter Strike Source and FIFA.
