<p>I am a Computer Science undergrad studying at IIT Roorkee. I am interested in information security. I've tried my hands on binary exploitation, cryptography but love web security in particular. I'm also doing a project based on a web honeypot under GSoC'17. I keep myself updated about security issues through participating in ctfs, HackerOne, Twitter and Hacker News. I'm a member of InfoSecIITR, a group of security enthusiasts at IIT Roorkee. I also design challenges for ctfs hosted on backdoor.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in development. I haven't used any jekyll theme for this website but built it from scratch. The reason being I'm a big fan of Materail Design and I couldn't find a simple, clean jekyll theme using Materail Design. I'll be open sourcing it soon.</p>
<p>Apart from this, I like, ooh sorry love cricket. I can watch and play cricket all day. I watch movies, TV shows and sometimes play games mostly Counter Strike Source and FIFA.
