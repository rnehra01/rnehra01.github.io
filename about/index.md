I am a Computer Science undergrad studying at IIT Roorkee. I am interested in information security. I've tried my hands on binary exploitation, cryptography but love web security in particular. I successfully added a few emulators to emulate web vulnerabilities in a web honeypot under [GSoC'17](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/wiki/GSoC-2017-Work-Submission). I keep myself updated about security through participating in ctfs, HackerOne, Twitter and Hacker News. I'm a member of [InfoSecIITR](https://infoseciitr.github.io/), a group of security enthusiasts at IIT Roorkee. I also design challenges for ctfs hosted on [backdoor](https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/users/rnehra01). I maintain [web-cheats](https://github.com/rnehra01/web-cheats) to remember the tricks employed during ctfs. Also I really like to read about operating systems, networks and computer architecture. While learning about ARP Spoofing, I created a [tool](https://github.com/rnehra01/arp-validator) to detect ARP Spoofing attacks.

Apart from this, I like, ooh sorry love cricket. I can watch and play cricket all day. I watch movies, TV shows and sometimes play multiplayer games mostly Counter Strike Source, WWE and FIFA. Though I played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor during my last semester in college and I really liked the concept of Shadow of Mordor.
